PySpark Module 1: Essentials of Apache Spark
Lesson 1.1 – What is Apache Spark?

Learning Objective:
Understand the purpose and power of Apache Spark, how it differs from traditional processing frameworks, and where PySpark fits in.

What is Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is a powerful, open-source big data processing engine built for speed, ease of use, and analytics. It was originally developed at UC Berkeley and later became a top-level Apache project.

Why Use Apache Spark?

Apache Spark is used because it:

Processes large-scale data very fast (in-memory computation)

Supports batch, real-time streaming, SQL, machine learning, and graph processing

Can run on a cluster of machines (distributed computing)

Works well with Hadoop, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, and more

Key Advantages:

Speed: Up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce

Ease of Use: APIs available in Python (PySpark), Scala, Java, and R

Flexibility: Handles diverse workloads including ETL, ML, analytics, and graphs

Unified Engine: Single platform for both batch and streaming workloads

Where is Spark Used?

Example applications:

Analyzing clickstream data to understand customer behavior

Detecting fraud using real-time data pipelines

Powering recommendation systems like those used by Netflix and Amazon

Building ETL pipelines for massive data lakes

What is PySpark?

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark

It allows you to write Python code that interacts with the Spark engine

It is ideal for data analysts and engineers who already work with Python libraries like pandas or NumPy

Spark vs Traditional Data Systems:

Traditional data systems like Hadoop MapReduce process data step-by-step and write intermediate results to disk, making them slow.

Apache Spark processes data in-memory using RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets), which reduces I/O operations and improves speed.

Analogy: Spark as a Restaurant Kitchen

Ingredients = Raw data

Recipes = Transformations or logic

Chefs = Spark worker nodes

Waiters = PySpark API

Multiple chefs work in parallel to prepare the meal quickly. That’s how Spark does parallel processing.

Mini Quiz:

List three advantages of Apache Spark.

Why is Spark faster than traditional MapReduce?

What is PySpark and how is it used?

Give one real-world example of Spark application.

Reflection Exercise:

Write a few sentences describing:

Where have you encountered large-scale data in your organization or work?

How might a tool like Apache Spark help in such scenarios?
