# Python Academy Course - Module 5

## Lesson 5.2 — Tuples in Python (Very Detailed)

---

### 🌟 Learning Goal:

> Understand what tuples are, how they differ from lists, and how to use them effectively in Python programs.

---

## 🔢 1. What is a Tuple?

* A **tuple** is a Python data structure used to store **multiple items**.
* Tuples are **ordered** but **immutable** (you cannot change their values after creation).
* Tuples are defined using **parentheses** `()`.

**Example:**

```python
employee_info = ("Alice", "HR", 6000)
```

---

## 🔢 2. Creating Tuples

### a) With parentheses:

```python
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
```

### b) Without parentheses (not recommended):

```python
tuple2 = "apple", "banana"
```

### c) Single-item tuple:

```python
single = (5,)  # Comma is necessary!
```

---

## 🔢 3. Accessing Tuple Elements

Use indexing (like lists):

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
print(colors[0])    # red
print(colors[-1])   # blue
```

---

## 🔢 4. Tuple Immutability

Once created, you **cannot change** the items in a tuple:

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
colors[0] = "yellow"  # ❌ Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

---

## 🔢 5. Tuple Operations

### a) Length of tuple:

```python
len(colors)
```

### b) Check existence:

```python
"green" in colors
```

### c) Looping through a tuple:

```python
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

### d) Tuple slicing:

```python
print(colors[1:3])  # ('green', 'blue')
```

### e) Tuple concatenation:

```python
a = (1, 2)
b = (3, 4)
c = a + b  # (1, 2, 3, 4)
```

---

## 🔢 6. Why Use Tuples?

* Tuples use **less memory** and are **faster** than lists.
* Useful for storing **read-only data**.
* Often used to **return multiple values** from a function.

**Example:**

```python
def get_employee():
    return ("Alice", "Finance", 7500)
```

---

## 🛠️ Hands-On Exercise 5.2

1. Create a tuple of 4 city names.
2. Access and print the second city.
3. Check if a city exists in the tuple.
4. Concatenate two tuples.
5. Slice and print the last two elements of a tuple.

---

## 🔍 Mini Quiz 5.2

1. Can you change the value of a tuple after it's created?
2. What is the correct way to define a single-item tuple?
3. Which operator is used to join two tuples?
4. How do you access the last element in a tuple?
5. Are tuples ordered?

---

## 🔹 Summary of Lesson 5.2

* Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences.
* Defined using `()` and accessed by index.
* Cannot be modified after creation.
* Useful for fixed data and function return values.
* Support slicing, concatenation, and looping.
