PySpark Module 1: Essentials of Apache Spark
Lesson 1.1 – What is Apache Spark?

Learning Objective

    - Understand the purpose and power of Apache Spark.
    - Learn how it differs from traditional data processing frameworks.
    - Know where PySpark fits into the Spark ecosystem.

What is Apache Spark?

    - Apache Spark is an open-source distributed computing engine for large-scale data processing.
    - It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python (PySpark), and R.
    - Originally developed at UC Berkeley and now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation.

Why Use Apache Spark?

    Apache Spark is used because it:

        - Processes massive datasets quickly through in-memory computation.
        - Supports multiple workloads such as:
            - Batch processing
            - Real-time stream processing
            - SQL queries
            - Machine learning
            - Graph computation
        - Can run on various cluster managers (e.g., Hadoop YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos, or standalone).
        - Integrates well with storage systems like HDFS, S3, and Azure Blob Storage.

Key Advantages

    - Speed: Up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce due to in-memory execution.
    - Simplicity: Simple APIs for complex data operations using DataFrames and RDDs.
    - Flexibility: One platform for SQL, streaming, ML, and graph.
    - Scalability: Easily scales from a laptop to thousands of nodes in a cluster.

Where is Spark Used?

    Common real-world use cases:

        - Clickstream analysis in e-commerce
        - Fraud detection in financial systems
        - Real-time dashboards and log processing
        - ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines
        - Recommendation engines in media and retail
        - Processing and analyzing IoT sensor data

What is PySpark?

    - PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark.
    - Enables Python developers to write Spark applications using familiar syntax.
    - Ideal for:
        - Data engineers building scalable ETL pipelines.
        - Data analysts working with large datasets.
        - Data scientists doing distributed model training and inference.

Spark vs Traditional Systems

    Traditional Data Systems (e.g., Hadoop MapReduce):

        - Disk-based intermediate storage after each step.
        - Higher latency.
        - Slower for iterative algorithms (like machine learning).

    Apache Spark:

        - Performs operations in-memory using RDDs and DataFrames.
        - Minimizes disk I/O, resulting in faster processing.
        - Efficient for iterative processing and complex pipelines.

Analogy: Spark as a Restaurant Kitchen

    Think of Spark like a restaurant kitchen:

        - Ingredients → Raw data
        - Recipes → Transformations and logic
        - Chefs → Executors processing data
        - Waiters → APIs like PySpark

    Just like multiple chefs prepare food in parallel, Spark processes chunks of data across multiple workers in parallel.

Mini Quiz

    1. List three advantages of Apache Spark.
    2. Why is Spark faster than traditional MapReduce?
    3. What is PySpark and how is it used?
    4. Give one real-world use case for Spark.

Reflection Exercise

    Write 3-5 lines on:

        - A situation in your work where large-scale data is involved.
        - How Spark or PySpark could improve that process.
