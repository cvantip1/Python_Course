## Lesson 5.3 — Sets in Python (Very Detailed)

---

### 🌟 Learning Goal:

> Understand what sets are, how they differ from lists/tuples, and how to use set operations to handle unique and unordered collections in Python.

---

## 🔢 1. What is a Set?

* A **set** is an unordered collection of **unique** items.
* Sets are **mutable** (can be changed), but **cannot contain duplicate values**.
* Sets are defined using **curly braces `{}`** or the `set()` constructor.

**Example:**

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
```

---

## 🔢 2. Creating Sets

### a) Using `{}`:

```python
fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```

### b) Using `set()` constructor:

```python
empty_set = set()  # not {}
```

> `{}` creates an empty dictionary by default!

---

## 🔢 3. Set Properties

* **Unordered**: No indexing, no order guaranteed.
* **No duplicates**:

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}
print(numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```

---

## 🔢 4. Accessing and Iterating

You **cannot** access items by index. Use loops:

```python
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

---

## 🔢 5. Adding and Removing Items

### a) `.add()` — add one item:

```python
fruits.add("mango")
```

### b) `.update()` — add multiple items:

```python
fruits.update(["orange", "grape"])
```

### c) `.remove()` — remove specific item (raises error if not found):

```python
fruits.remove("apple")
```

### d) `.discard()` — remove item if it exists (no error):

```python
fruits.discard("banana")
```

### e) `.clear()` — remove all items:

```python
fruits.clear()
```

---

## 🔢 6. Set Operations

Sets are useful for **mathematical set operations**:

### a) Union — combine all elements

```python
A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}
print(A | B)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

### b) Intersection — common elements

```python
print(A & B)  # {3}
```

### c) Difference — items in A but not in B

```python
print(A - B)  # {1, 2}
```

### d) Symmetric Difference — not common in either

```python
print(A ^ B)  # {1, 2, 4, 5}
```

## 🛠️ Hands-On Exercise 5.3

1. Create a set of employee roles: `{"Analyst", "Manager", "Engineer"}`.
2. Add "Intern" to the set.
3. Remove "Manager" using `.discard()`.
4. Create another set: `{"Consultant", "Engineer"}`
5. Find:

   * Union of both sets
   * Intersection
   * Difference (roles in first set but not in second)

---

## 🔍 Mini Quiz 5.3

1. What is the main difference between a set and a list?
2. Can a set contain duplicate values?
3. Which method allows you to safely remove an item without error?
4. What does the `^` operator do between two sets?
5. What is the output of `{1, 2, 3} & {2, 3, 4}`?

---

## 🔹 Summary of Lesson 5.3

* Sets store unique, unordered items.
* No duplicates, and no indexing.
* Use `.add()`, `.update()`, `.remove()`, `.discard()` to manage items.
* Support union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations.
