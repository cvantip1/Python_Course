    "Objective: Build an expense tracker that records each transaction and calculates the total expenses. Users can add expenses with categories (e.g., \"Food\", \"Transportation\", \"Entertainment\"). The program should provide a summary of expenses by category and the total amount spent. All records should be saved to a CSV file.\n",
